# Autosplitters

## OpenMBU

Autosplitter for [OpenMBU Beta 1.11 or newer](https://openmbu.com/download/all). Since OpenMBU Beta 1.11, we generate an autosplitter text file which can be tailed and will be populated with data that will drive the LiveSplit autosplitter script.

### Features

* Auto start is supported. The the timer will automatically start when you select the first level in a category.
	* The levels that will start the timer are configurable.
* Automatic splits are supported on level completion and easter egg collection.
	* These splits are completely configurable. You can choose on which levels or easter eggs you want the autosplitter to perform a split.
* Load removal is supported and will take out any load times from the "Game Time" in LiveSplit.

## Marble Blast Gold

Autosplitter for [Marble Blast Gold 1.4.1 non-ignition](https://marbleblast.com/index.php/downloads/mbg). Also works with the [framerate unlocker](https://marbleblast.com/index.php/forum/mb-mods-misc/7696-marble-blast-frame-rate-unlocker). It's still a bit WIP and might have a few bugs, so please report any issues you may have with it.

Thanks to CaptainRektbeard for tremendous help in getting the $Game::State variable stable in the autosplitter!

### Features
